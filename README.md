# Spica

Spica is an iOS Client for [Alles Micro](https://alles.cx). It's privacy focused and easy to use.

## Build & Install

Spica uses Cocoapods. We decided to remove the Pods/ directory from source control so some additional steps are necessary.

NOTE: You need a mac and Xcode :)

1. Make sure you have Cocoapods installed (`pod --version`)
  - If not install it via `sudo gem install cocoapods`
2. Navigate to the projects root directory
3. Run `pod install`
4. Open Spica.xcworkspace (do not open Spica.xcodeproj, it won't work)
5. Set a new development team
6. Run
